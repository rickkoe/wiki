<p>Setting up Key servers on TS4500 using TLS1.2 isn't very well documented. &nbsp;Here's how we got it to work at Prime:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Go to Settings → Security → Secure Communications and set to <strong>On </strong>(you will lose browser access for about 5 minutes. &nbsp;It gives a timer, but takes way longer to come back than that).</li>
  <li>Go to the GKLM server, Advanced Configuration → System Certificates and download the key serving cert in base 64.</li>
  <li>Open the cert in notepad ++, ctrl-H, regular expression button, find \r and replace with nothing. &nbsp;Save as a .pem file</li>
  <li>Go to Settings → Security → Encryption Key Servers<ul>
      <li>Click on one of the key servers, Actions → Modify</li>
      <li>Change security to TLS 1.2 and set the port to 1441</li>
      <li>Import the .pem file that was exported from GKLM and modified in the earlier step.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Run Diagnostics on the key server to ensure full key path is working.</li>
</ul>
