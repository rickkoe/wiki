<h1>Deleting a Cluster Export Services node from an IBM Storage Scale cluster</h1>
<p>Use this information to delete a Cluster Export Services (CES) node from an IBM Storage Scale cluster.</p>
<ol>
  <li>On a node other than the one you want to delete from the cluster, issue the following command to suspend the node:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext"># mmces node suspend –N &lt;Node_to_Delete&gt;</code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;2. On the node that you want to delete from the cluster, issue the following commands to stop the CES services:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext"># mmces service stop nfs
# mmces service stop smb
# mmces service stop s3</code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this example, it is assumed that all three protocols are enabled on the node that you want to delete from the cluster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;3. On a node other than the one you want to delete from the cluster, issue the following command to disable CES on the node:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext"># mmchnode –N &lt;Node_to_Delete&gt; --ces-disable</code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;4. On a node other than the one you want to delete from the cluster, issue the following command to shut down GPFS on the node:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext"># mmshutdown –N &lt;Node_to_Delete&gt;</code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;5. On a node other than the one you want to delete from the cluster, issue the following command to delete the node from the cluster:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext"># mmdelnode –N &lt;Node_to_Delete&gt;</code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;6. If you disabled file audit logging in step 1, you can enable it by following the instructions in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/STXKQY_5.2.1/com.ibm.spectrum.scale.v5r10.doc/bl1adm_adlgenabling.html#adlgenabling">Enabling file audit logging on a file system</a>.</p>
